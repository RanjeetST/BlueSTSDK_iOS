# BlueST SDK

BlueST is a multi-platform library (Android and iOS supported) that permits easy access to the data exported by a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that implements the BlueST protocol.

## BlueST Protocol

### Advertise
The library will show only the device that has a vendor-specific field formatted in the following way:

|Length|  1       |1           | 1                |1          | 4              | 6        |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
|Name  | Length   | Field Type | Protocol Version | Device Id | Feature Mask   | Device MAC (optional)|
|Value | 0x07/0xD | 0xFF       | 0x01             | 0xXX      | 0xXXXXXXXX | 0xXXXXXXXXXXXX|


 - The Field Length must be 7 or 13 bytes long.
 
 - The Device Id is a number that identifies the type of device. It is used to select different types of feature mask and can manage more than 32 features.
Currently used values are:
    - 0x00 for a generic device
    - 0x01 is reserved for the [STEVAL-WESU1](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-wesu1.html) board
    - 0x02 is reserved for the [STEVAL-STLKT01V1 (SensorTile)](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/solution-evaluation-tools/sensor-solution-eval-boards/steval-stlkt01v1.html) board
    - 0x03 is reserved for the [STEVAL-BCNKT01V1 (BlueCoin)](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/solution-evaluation-tools/sensor-solution-eval-boards/steval-bcnkt01v1.html) board
    - 0x04 is reserved for the [STEVAL-IDB008V1/2 (BlueNRG-2)](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/solution-evaluation-tools/communication-and-connectivity-solution-eval-boards/steval-idb008v2.html) board
    - 0x05 is reserved for the [STEVAL-BCN002V1B (BlueNRG-Tile)](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/solution-evaluation-tools/sensor-solution-eval-boards/steval-bcn002v1b.html) board
    - 0x06 is reserved for the [STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1 (SensorTile.Box )](https://www.st.com/sensortilebox) board
    - 0x07 is reserved for the [B-L475E-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) board
    - 0x80 to 0x8A for a differents ST Functional pack based on Nucleo boards

  You should use a value between 0x04 and 0x7F for your custom board, as values between 0x80 and 0xFF are reserved for ST Nucleo boards.
 
 - The feature mask is a bit field that provides information regarding what characteristics/features are exported by the board.
Currently, bits are mapped in the following way:

|Bit|31|30|29|28|27|26|25|24|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|RFU|ADPCM Sync|Switch|Direction of arrival|ADPC Audio|MicLevel|Proximity|Lux|

|Bit|23|22|21|20|19|18|17|16|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|Acc|Gyro|Mag|Pressure|Humidity|Temperature|Battery|Second Temperature|

|Bit|15|14|13|12|11|10|9|8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|CO Sensor|STM32WB Reboot bit | STM32WB OTA Reboot bit|SD Logging|Beam forming|AccEvent|FreeFall|Sensor Fusion Compact|

|Bit|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|Sensor Fusion|Motion intensity|Compass|Activity|Carry Position|ProximityGesture|MemsGesture|Pedometer|

a custom bitmask is defined for the SensorTile.box board:

|Bit|31|30|29|28|27|26|25|24|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|FFT Amplitude|ADPCM Sync|Switch|MEMS Norm|ADPC Audio|MicLevel|Audio Classification|RFU|

|Bit|23|22|21|20|19|18|17|16|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|Acc|Gyro|Mag|Pressure|Humidity|Temperature|Battery|Second Temperature|

|Bit|15|14|13|12|11|10|9|8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|RFU|Euler Angle|RFU|SD Logging|RFU|AccEvent|EventCounter|Sensor Fusion Compact|

|Bit|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Feature|Sensor Fusion|Motion intensity|Compass|Activity|Carry Position|RFU|MemsGesture|Pedometer|


You can use one of the RFU bits or define a new device and decide how to map the feature. 
To see how the data is exported by pre-defined features, consult the export method [<code> Feature.ExtractResult Feature.extractData(long,byte[],int)</code>](https://stmicroelectronics.github.io/BlueSTSDK_Android/javadoc/com/st/BlueSTSDK/Feature.html#extractData-long-byte:A-int-).  within the feature class definition.


- The device MAC address is optional and useful only for obtaining the device MAC address on an iOS device.


### Characteristics/Features
A bluetooth characteristics can export multiple features. The SDK is searching in all the services the know characteristics.
The features that are present in the advertise feature mask have an UUID such as: <code>*XXXXXXXX*-0001-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code>, and are called "Basic Feature"
The first 32bits are interpreted as the feature mask, if they are set to 1 it meas that the characteristics is exporting the data of
that feature.

The other ST characteristics have the format: <code>*XXXXXXXX*-0002-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code> and are called "extended Feature"
 
 In case of multiple features mapped in a single characteristic, the data must be in the same order as the bit mask.
 
 The characteristic data format must be:
 
| Length |     2     |         >1         |          >1         |       |
|:------:|:---------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:-----:|
|  Name  | Timestamp | First Feature Data | Second Feature Data | ..... |
  
 The first 2 bytes are used to communicate a time stamp. This is especially useful for recognizing any data loss.
 
 Since the BLE packet max length is 20 bytes, the max size for a feature data field is 18 bytes.
 
#### Remote Feature
This type of Feature are created for handle the case when the node collect information from 
other boards the user want to know also how produced the data.

For this type of feature a node ID is attach at the beginning of a standard feature update message.

For this type of feature the characteristic data format must be:
 
| Length |     2     |        2         |      >1       |       |
|:------:|:---------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|  Name  |  NodeID   | Remote timestamp | Feature Data  | ..... |


### Special Services
#### [Debug](https://stmicroelectronics.github.io/BlueSTSDK_iOS/doc/html/interface_blue_s_t_s_d_k_debug.html)
If available, the debug service must have the UUID <code>00000000-000E-11e1-9ab4-0002a5d5c51b</code> and will contains 2 characteristics:

- <code>00000001-000E-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code> (Notify/Write) is used to send string commands to the board and to notify the user of the result.
- <code>00000002-000E-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code> (Notify) is used by the board to notify the user of an error message.

#### Configuration
If available, the configuration service must have the UUID <code>00000000-000F-11e1-9ab4-0002a5d5c51b</code> and will contain 2 characteristics:

- <code>00000002-000F-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code> (Notify/Write): it can be used to send command/data to a specific feature.

    The request message must have the following format:
    
    | Length |             4            |    1    | 0-15         |
    |:------:|:------------------------:|:-------:|--------------|
    |  Name  | Destination Feature Mask | Command Id | Command Data |
  
    Where the first 4 bytes will select the recipient of the command/data package.
  
    The optional command answer must have the following format:
    
    | Length |     2     |          4          |      1     |     0-13    |
    |:------:|:---------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
    |  Name  | Timestamp | Sender Feature Mask | Command Id | Answer Data |
    
  From the SDK point of view the messages are sent using the method [<code>BlueSTSDKFeature::sendCommand:data:</code>](https://stmicroelectronics.github.io/BlueSTSDK_iOS/doc/html/interface_blue_s_t_s_d_k_feature.html#a669cd03b94a0d0c9649ecef6af22645b) and the answer is notified with a callback passed through the method [<code>BlueSTSDKFeature::parseCommandResponseWithTimestamp:commandType::data:</code>](https://stmicroelectronics.github.io/BlueSTSDK_iOS/doc/com/html/interface_blue_s_t_s_d_k_feature.html#a16e1c4d33cc52bc5b19f55c126e).
 
  If this characteristic does not exist, but the characteristics that export the feature is in 
  write mode, the *command id* and the *command data* are sending directly to the feature 
  characteristics. In this case is not possible answer to the command.

- <code>00000001-000F-11e1-ac36-0002a5d5c51b</code> (Read/Write/Notify): if available it is used to access the board configuration register that can be modified using the [<code>BlueSTSDKConfigControl</code>](https://stmicroelectronics.github.io/BlueSTSDK_iOS/doc/html/interface_blue_s_t_s_d_k_config_control.html) class.
